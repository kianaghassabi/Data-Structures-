# Python


This repository will contain python based examples of many
popular algorithms and data structures.

Each algorithm and data structure has its own separate README
with related explanations and links for further reading.

## Data Structures

A data structure is a particular way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can
be accessed and modified efficiently. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data
values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to
the data.

## Algorithms

An algorithm is an unambiguous specification of how to solve a class of problems. It is
a set of rules that precisely define a sequence of operations.
